# vibe_coding

Overview:
This is a simple Roblox obby (obstacle course) designed for the NOS 110 Vibe-Coding Jam. Players navigate through platforms, touch checkpoints that trigger random spam ads, and interact with a special part that displays a humorous “AI has taken over” message. The obby includes a Team Bio sign at the start, making it interactive while demonstrating basic Roblox Studio and Lua scripting concepts.

Contributions:
This obby project was a collaborative effort between two team members. My partner was responsible for designing and building the obby layout, placing parts, and setting up the AI Overlord feature. I managed the GitHub repository, created the Deployment.md file, added the spam ads and Team Bio sign, and assisted with scripting. Together, we ensured all required features were implemented, tested, and fully functional for presentation.

Codebase:
The project was developed in Roblox Studio, using Lua for scripting. AI-assisted code was utilized for the spam ads and AI Overlord scripts, with all AI-generated sections clearly commented in the code. The project includes a structured Explorer hierarchy with Workspace parts, StarterGui for GUI elements, and StarterPlayerScripts for player-specific interactions, ensuring an organized and maintainable codebase.
