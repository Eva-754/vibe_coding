Contributions: This blog project was a collaborative effort between two team members. My partner was responsible for designing and developing the website, including implementing all the features and creating the HTML structure. I managed the GitHub repository by setting up version control, created the presentation materials, and wrote the deployment document to guide others on how to publish and maintain the blog. I also helped my partner with adding the required features we needed from the wheel. Together, we combined our skills to successfully complete the project and ensure it is well-documented and easy to deploy.
