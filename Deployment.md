Prerequisites
GitHub account
Repository containing your HTML blog files (index.html, assets folders)
Access to GitHub Codespaces (or a similar cloud IDE)
Basic understanding of Git and GitHub Pages (optional)
Running the HTML Blog in GitHub Codespaces
Open your repository in GitHub Codespaces

Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
Click the green Code button → Open with Codespaces → New codespace.
This will open a VS Code environment in your browser with your project loaded.
Preview your HTML file

Locate your index.html in the file explorer panel.
Right-click and select Open with Live Server if available.
Alternatively, click on the file and use the built-in preview or open it via the browser preview tab in Codespaces.
Edit and save your files

Make changes to your HTML, CSS, or assets as needed.
Save the files to see live reload in the preview.
Deploying the Blog Using GitHub Pages
Push your latest code to GitHub

Commit and push any changes you made in Codespaces back to the repository.
Enable GitHub Pages

Go to the repository on GitHub.
Navigate to Settings → Pages.
Under Source, select the branch (main or master) and folder (/ root) where your HTML files are located.
Click Save.
Access your live blog

After a few moments, GitHub Pages will publish your site.
Your blog will be available at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/.
Troubleshooting
If the preview doesn’t load in Codespaces, ensure the Live Server extension is installed and enabled.
Check file paths in your HTML if assets don’t appear correctly.
If GitHub Pages is not showing your blog, verify you selected the correct branch and folder in settings.
Updating Your Blog
Make edits in Codespaces or locally.
Commit and push changes to GitHub.
GitHub Pages will update automatically within a few minutes.
